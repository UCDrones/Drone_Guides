### Advanced Settings


![Advanced Settings Page](images\MC\DJI-MC-Advanced-Settings.jpg)
The Advanced Settings page allows us access to a few different aircraft sensitivity settings.

1. EXP

![EXP settings](images\MC\DJI-ExpSettings.jpg)

Tuning the EXP settings allows you to increase/decrease stick input sensitivity. The X-axis indicates user stick input and the Y-axis represents the "value" being output to the motors from these stick inputs. The higher the value, the more sensitive the drone can be towards the input stick movement. This is not to be confused with the next setting below. 

2. Sensitivity

![Sensitivity settings](images\MC\DJI-SensitivitySettings.jpg)

The sensitivity setting affects how rapidly the drone will respond to the input. A higher value would cause the drone to react more aggressively while a lower value would dull out that same input.  

3. Gain

Generally, the gain settingss are left alone. 

*General comment for myself, try and get a drone to checkout some of these functions before you can specifically state what it is that they do. There are some contradicting pieces of information found on the "Gain" settings and I don't want to give the wrong words of advice for something that can be sensitive to errors.*

## Visual Navigation Settings
