"],["making-a-good-checklist.html", "Making a Good Checklist", " Making a Good Checklist A good checklist is a key component of safety. Here are some tips for making your checklists effective: Break down your checklist into sections, each with less than 10 items A long and detailed checklist may be necessary, but it can get difficult to read and to follow. Instead, break it down into smaller sections by inserting pause points at natural breaks. For example, for a pre-flight checklist, create a section related to just aircraft setup, followed by a section for GCS/transmitter checks. Determine whether your checklist is a Do-confirm or a Read-do checklist and keep it consistent A Do-confirm checklist is one where the checklist is used to confirm that an item is done - sometimes in order or out of order. This is common for experienced teams where everyone is aware of their responsibilities and are expected to work independently. A Read-do checklist is one where team members perform the tasks as they are read, like following a set of instructions. This form of a checklist works best with new groups, or where the order of operations is important. Which ever form your checklist takes, make sure that it is consistent throughout the document. Update your checklists A checklist is a living document - dont be afraid to update or change it if you find it to be deficient. Make it part of your post-flight documentation to think about whether your existing checklists had everything you needed it to have. Fit checklist sections into a single page While your checklists adjust and grow, make sure that they remain easy to read and to parse. Your checklist sections should remain contained within a single page - if you have an item that runs onto the next page, seperate the entire section to the new page, or reduce the font size to keep everyone on one page. If your section exceeds an entire page, consider breaking it down into smaller sections.

The lower the number the less sensitive your camera is to light and the finer the grain. By choosing a higher ISO you can use a faster shutter speed to freeze the movement. Higher numbers mean your sensor becomes more sensitive to light which allows you to use your camera in darker situations, but the cost of doing so is more grain. Shutter Speed The Shutter controls for how long light is let into the lenses. To simplify the shutter, a low shutter speed lets more light in and is good for taking pictures in dim lighting while a high shutter speed lets in more light and is good for taking crisp shots of moving objects or people. In S mode, you can set the shutter speed, but other settings will be set automatically to match exposure. Aperature This controls how much light gets through when you take a picture. This is measured in f-stops. A smaller f-stop number means a bigger aperture and so more light comes through, and a bigger f-stop number means a smaller aperture, so less light comes through. In A mode, you can set the Aperture, but other settings will still be set automatically to match exposure. Photo Settings Single Shot The standard mode, it takes a 1 picture every time you tap the shoot button. HDR Shot The camera will take three images of the same scene. One will be underexposed, another overexposed and the last will be properly exposed then it will combine the three images to create a more dynamic JPEG. Multiple With this mode, the camera will take multiple pictures when you press the shoot button. You might want to use this mode if you are trying to get a shot of a moving subject. AEB (Automatic Exposure Bracketing) A set of 3 or 5 shots that work similarly to HDR Shots taking overexposed, underexposed and properly exposed photos. However, in AEB the images are in RAW and they are not combine. Timed Shot This allows you to set a countdown timer before the shot is taken, its useful for taking selfies. Pano 180° Panorama mode can stitch 21 photos together to create a 180° panoramic photo. ShallowFocus This mode allows you to create a depth of field effect in your photo. Other Settings Image Size You can choose the size of your picture 4:3,16:9 3:2. 4:3 was the old standard 33mm size. 16:9 is the common size for HD capable devices and 3:2 is the traditional size for printed photos. Image Format In this area, you can choose between taking photos in RAW, JPEG and RAW + JPEG. Raw is a file format that captures all image data recorded by the sensor when you take a photo. JPEG a format for compressing image files. White Balance This is the process of removing unrealistic color casts so that objects which appear white in person are rendered white in your photo. It is measured in Kelvins. If you have Auto selected, then the camera will decide what the best setting is. You can also choose from a selection of profiles or set it yourself. Kelvin Temperature is simply a unit of measurement for temperature and in photography we most often use it to measure the color temperature of light sources. The temperature scale most often used in photography ranges from about 2000K (K=Kelvin) to 9000K. Style This is where you can configure the sharpness, contrast, and saturation of the images or videos that your drones camera takes. (Triangle) Digital Sharpness this makes the picture sharper. (Circle) Contrast controls the strength of the lights and the darks in the picture. (Rectangle) Saturation of colors low saturation makes the photos look dull, and high saturation make the colors pop. These can be set in a range of -3 to +3. Color Here you can set the camera color profile. These settings affect the colors in your photo. D  Cinelike and D Log are both designed for taking photos that will be post-processed later on. The rest of the color profiles are ready to go with no post-processing required. Weather Considerations Cloudy and Overcast Days A cloudy and Overcast day gives an amazing amount of diffused light. You can also shoot in the middle of the day with little worry about harsh lighting or unwanted shadows. Theres a catch though when shooting scenary feel in overcast conditions can also be challenging. Overcast skies are gray and dont usually add a lot of interest to that mountainscape, or field of cows you want to photograph. Look for stormy weather clouds, that add a sense of place and dimension. You can also crop your shot so that you dont get those unwanted gray skies, but still get great lighting. This means you will be shooting with the lower side of the settings like lower aperature, ISO, and Shutter Speed. Sunny Days Landscapes in bright sun are absolutely beautiful. Try shooting the beach in the full sun of the day usually around 1 or 2pm. Practice exposing for the beautiful blue skies as well as the sand. Make sure you have high aperature, ISO, and Shutterspeed to keep your shots from being over exposed. Of course this is always mannual correction when editing, but you want to take photos that need little to none editing when shooting. Practice Make sure you are always going back to shots and making sure they what you had in mind with the settings and the feel you are going for. You do not want to take a shot and then just think it was good enough, I always like to have about 4-6 shots with different settings and different feels. The reason being is that its always better to have opitions, because sometimes what you get out and about does not look the same when your uploading.

Advanced Settings The Advanced Settings page allows us access to a few different aircraft sensitivity settings. EXP EXP settings Tuning the EXP settings allows you to increase/decrease stick input sensitivity. The X-axis indicates user stick input and the Y-axis represents the value being output to the motors from these stick inputs. The higher the value, the more sensitive the drone can be towards the input stick movement. This is not to be confused with the next setting below. Sensitivity Sensitivity settings The sensitivity setting affects how rapidly the drone will respond to the input. A higher value would cause the drone to react more aggressively while a lower value would dull out that same input. Gain Gain settings Generally, the gain settingss are left alone. General comment for myself, try and get a drone to checkout some of these functions before you can specifically state what it is that they do. There are some contradicting pieces of information found on the Gain settings and I dont want to give the wrong words of advice for something that can be sensitive to errors.

First off, I would recommend starting with this video from Tony and Chelsea Northuo. This video gives a brief overview of all the topics that you will need to study. Do not trust the comments that state that they passed by only watching that video. After watching the video, I would recommend memorizing Part 107 by the numbers. Not on this list are the conditions at standard sea level (chapter 3b of study guide). Next, I will break down the official FAA study guide. Videos will only get you 50% of the way on the new exam. Sorry to say, but you will have to read some parts of this study guide. Chapter 2: For each airspace class, know the ceiling and floor heights. This is very important for reading sectional charts. I had a question ask Go 5 NM east of this point. What airspace are you in?. Do not assume anything. A solid red line is class C, but you could be above the ceiling, making it class E. For the special use airspaces and other airspace areas, understand what happens in each case. I had questions that asked What would you expected in a restricted area and At what speeds should you expect military aircrafts to be at in Military Training Routes. Chapter 3: Reading METARs and TAFs are relatively straightforward. I watched a few YouTube videos to figure it out. For the sky condition acronyms, you would only need to memorize the common ones. Chapter 3b is quite annoying because there is a lot of information in there, but the exam will only choose a few topics. Topics that should definitely be on there are density altitude, stable/unstable air, and clouds. The rest is just the luck of the draw. 15% of my exam was about this section. Chapter 4: This is similar to chapter 3b where they throw a bunch of different information at you and only select a few on the exam. Things to note from this chapter are how CP and CG positioning changes the nose direction, effects of weight on performance, and calculating load factor. Chapter 5: This chapter is short, so Id say to just read it. Chapter 7: I got two questions from this section. One was about the military alphabet and the other was about frequencies. Chapter 9: Memorize the definitions to a teethings like causes, symptoms, effects on PIC, and what the PIC should do. Some questions will give you different scenarios and ask you what the best solution is. One scenario my colleague got was You just drank a bottle of beer, but you feel fine. What should should you do?. Chapter 10: My main mistakes in the exam were from this section. This was because all the YouTube study guides I watched passed this section. From this section, I got questions on the steps of decision making, assessing and mitigating risk, hazardous attitudes, etc. This is another section I would study up on. Depending on your exam, I would say chapter 9 and 10 make up 25% of the exam. Chapter 11: Sectional charts cover about 30% of your exam. I would say to just watch video after video to understand this. They will ask a lot of questions about airspace, ceilings, floors, finding certain landmarks, etc. Check this video out to see if you got tricked https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21b9hODOhGc .If you did, I would recommend studying more. As of 2021, the FAA has included new questions on flight over people and remote identification (I got 4 questions on these). None of the study guides or YouTube videos online had these questions. I had to read through the two links provided by the FAA. https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/operations_over_people/ https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/remote_id/ I HIGHLY recommend that you take this practice exam to get a rough estimate on what score you will get. https://3drobotics.com/quiz/faa-part-107/ Then watch the explanation video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IEjiWiFf5E&amp;t=0s Even after I prepared for the exam, there were still questions that I was not prepared for. When I checked the FAA study guide, sure enough, the answer was there. You dont have to read the entire study guide, but I would recommended skimming it. Remember to take you time. Two hours gives you plenty of time to think. Bookmark the problems you are not sure of. Good luck!
