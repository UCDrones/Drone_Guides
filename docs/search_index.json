["ch-camera-settings.html", "Chapter 2 How to Set Your Settings For Good Media Cinematography 2.1 Settings within a Drone 2.2 Example Scenarios", " Chapter 2 How to Set Your Settings For Good Media Cinematography Confused at all the camera settings available for your drone? Here’s a quick guide to figure things out. 2.1 Settings within a Drone ISO Aperature Shutter Speed Image ratio Image Format White Balance Style Color 2.1.1 Iso ISO measures the sensitivity of the image sensor. The lower the number the less sensitive your camera is to light and the finer the grain. By choosing a higher ISO you can use a faster shutter speed to freeze the movement. Higher numbers mean your sensor becomes more sensitive to light which allows you to use your camera in darker situations, but the cost of doing so is more grain. ** insert GIF picture #1 here ** 2.1.2 Aperature This controls how much light gets through when you take a picture. This is measured in ‘f-stops.’ A smaller f-stop number means a bigger aperture and so more light comes through, and a bigger f-stop number means a smaller aperture, so less light comes through. In A mode, you can set the Aperture, but other settings will still be set automatically to match exposure. *** insert GIF picture #2 here** 2.1.3 Shutter Speed The Shutter controls for how long light is let into the lenses. To simplify the shutter, a low shutter speed lets more light in and is good for taking pictures in dim lighting while a high shutter speed lets in more light and is good for taking crisp shots of moving objects or people. In S mode, you can set the shutter speed, but other settings will be set automatically to match exposure. (** Image gif #3) 2.1.4 Image Ratio is the ratio of its width to its height. You can choose the size of your picture 4:3 this is the old standard 35mm size that used to be common during the SD era of TVs. 16:9 this is the common size for HD capable devices and 3:2 is the traditional size for printed photos (3:2 P4P). Look at diagram below to understand. ** Image #4 ** 2.1.5 Image Format In this area, you can choose between taking photos in RAW, JPEG and RAW + JPEG. Raw is a file format that captures all image data recorded by the sensor when you take a photo. JPEG a format for compressing image files. ** IMAGE #5 *** 2.1.6 White Balance This is the process of removing unrealistic color casts so that objects which appear white in person are rendered white in your photo. It is measured in Kelvins. If you have Auto selected, then the camera will decide what the best setting is. You can also choose from a selection of profiles or set it yourself. Kelvin Temperature is simply a unit of measurement for temperature and in photography we most often use it to measure the color temperature of light sources. The temperature scale most often used in photography ranges from about 2000K (K=Kelvin) to 9000K. ** Image #6 ** 2.1.7 Style This is where you can configure the sharpness, contrast, and saturation of the images or videos that your drone’s camera takes. (Triangle) Digital Sharpness this makes the picture sharper. (Circle) Contrast controls the strength of the lights and the darks in the picture. (Rectangle) Saturation of colors low saturation makes the photos look dull, and high saturation make the colors pop. These can be set in a range of -3 to +3. ** image #7 ** 2.1.8 COLOR Here you can set the camera color profile. These settings affect the colors in your photo. D – Cinelike and D –Log are both designed for taking photos that will be post-processed later on. The rest of the color profiles are ready to go with no post-processing required. ** image # 8 ) 2.2 Example Scenarios "],

EXP EXP settings Tuning the EXP settings allows you to increase/decrease stick input sensitivity. The X-axis indicates user stick input and the Y-axis represents the “value” being output to the motors from these stick inputs. The higher the value, the more sensitive the drone can be towards the input stick movement. This is not to be confused with the next setting below. Sensitivity Sensitivity settings The sensitivity setting affects how rapidly the drone will respond to the input. A higher value would cause the drone to react more aggressively while a lower value would dull out that same input. Gain Gain settings Generally, the gain settingss are left alone. General comment for myself, try and get a drone to checkout some of these functions before you can specifically state what it is that they do. There are some contradicting pieces of information found on the “Gain” settings and I don’t want to give the wrong words of advice for something that can be sensitive to errors. 3.2 Visual Navigation Settings Visual Navigation Settings Page Visual Navigation Settings Logo Here we can toggle the Obstacle avoidance on and off, as well as the Radar Chart that displays real time obstacle detection. At the bottom we can again find Advanced Settings that pertain to the systems Visual navigation. 3.2.1 Advanced Settings Advanced Settings The Advanced Settings for the Visual Navigation Settings allow for the enabling/disabling of both the Downward vision positioning system and the return-to-home obstacle detection feature. 3.3 Remote Controller Settings add picture of settings page Remote Controller Calibration Stick Mode Button Customization Remote Controller Linking 3.4 Image Transmission Settings add picture of settings page Channel Mode Channel selection Image Transmission Code Rate 3.5 Aircraft battery Settings add picture of settings page Smart Return Home (RTH) Critical Battery Warning Low Battery Warning Flight Time (on battery) Show Voltage on Main Screen Time to Discharge Battery Details "]
