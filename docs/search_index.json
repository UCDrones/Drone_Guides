"],["making-a-good-checklist.html", "Making a Good Checklist", " Making a Good Checklist A good checklist is a key component of safety. Here are some tips for making your checklists effective: Break down your checklist into sections, each with less than 10 items A long and detailed checklist may be necessary, but it can get difficult to read and to follow. Instead, break it down into smaller sections by inserting pause points at natural breaks. For example, for a pre-flight checklist, create a section related to just aircraft setup, followed by a section for GCS/transmitter checks. Determine whether your checklist is a ‘Do-confirm’ or a ‘Read-do’ checklist and keep it consistent A ‘Do-confirm’ checklist is one where the checklist is used to confirm that an item is done - sometimes in order or out of order. This is common for experienced teams where everyone is aware of their responsibilities and are expected to work independently. A ‘Read-do’ checklist is one where team members perform the tasks as they are read, like following a set of instructions. This form of a checklist works best with new groups, or where the order of operations is important. Which ever form your checklist takes, make sure that it is consistent throughout the document. Update your checklists A checklist is a living document - don’t be afraid to update or change it if you find it to be deficient. Make it part of your post-flight documentation to think about whether your existing checklists had everything you needed it to have. Fit checklist sections into a single page While your checklists adjust and grow, make sure that they remain easy to read and to parse. Your checklist sections should remain contained within a single page - if you have an item that runs onto the next page, seperate the entire section to the new page, or reduce the font size to keep everyone on one page. If your section exceeds an entire page, consider breaking it down into smaller sections.

The lower the number the less sensitive your camera is to light and the finer the grain. By choosing a higher ISO you can use a faster shutter speed to freeze the movement. Higher numbers mean your sensor becomes more sensitive to light which allows you to use your camera in darker situations, but the cost of doing so is more grain. Shutter Speed The Shutter controls for how long light is let into the lenses. To simplify the shutter, a low shutter speed lets more light in and is good for taking pictures in dim lighting while a high shutter speed lets in more light and is good for taking crisp shots of moving objects or people. In S mode, you can set the shutter speed, but other settings will be set automatically to match exposure. Aperature This controls how much light gets through when you take a picture. This is measured in ‘f-stops.’ A smaller f-stop number means a bigger aperture and so more light comes through, and a bigger f-stop number means a smaller aperture, so less light comes through. In A mode, you can set the Aperture, but other settings will still be set automatically to match exposure. Photo Settings Single Shot The standard mode, it takes a 1 picture every time you tap the shoot button. HDR Shot The camera will take three images of the same scene. One will be underexposed, another overexposed and the last will be properly exposed then it will combine the three images to create a more dynamic JPEG. Multiple With this mode, the camera will take multiple pictures when you press the shoot button. You might want to use this mode if you are trying to get a shot of a moving subject. AEB (Automatic Exposure Bracketing) A set of 3 or 5 shots that work similarly to HDR Shots taking overexposed, underexposed and properly exposed photos. However, in AEB the images are in RAW and they are not combine. Timed Shot This allows you to set a countdown timer before the shot is taken, it’s useful for taking selfies. Pano 180° Panorama mode can stitch 21 photos together to create a 180° panoramic photo. ShallowFocus This mode allows you to create a depth of field effect in your photo. Other Settings Image Size You can choose the size of your picture 4:3,16:9 3:2. 4:3 was the old standard 33mm size. 16:9 is the common size for HD capable devices and 3:2 is the traditional size for printed photos. Image Format In this area, you can choose between taking photos in RAW, JPEG and RAW + JPEG. Raw is a file format that captures all image data recorded by the sensor when you take a photo. JPEG a format for compressing image files. White Balance This is the process of removing unrealistic color casts so that objects which appear white in person are rendered white in your photo. It is measured in Kelvins. If you have Auto selected, then the camera will decide what the best setting is. You can also choose from a selection of profiles or set it yourself. Kelvin Temperature is simply a unit of measurement for temperature and in photography we most often use it to measure the color temperature of light sources. The temperature scale most often used in photography ranges from about 2000K (K=Kelvin) to 9000K. Style This is where you can configure the sharpness, contrast, and saturation of the images or videos that your drone’s camera takes. (Triangle) Digital Sharpness this makes the picture sharper. (Circle) Contrast controls the strength of the lights and the darks in the picture. (Rectangle) Saturation of colors low saturation makes the photos look dull, and high saturation make the colors pop. These can be set in a range of -3 to +3. Color Here you can set the camera color profile. These settings affect the colors in your photo. D – Cinelike and D –Log are both designed for taking photos that will be post-processed later on. The rest of the color profiles are ready to go with no post-processing required. Weather Considerations Cloudy and Overcast Days A cloudy and Overcast day gives an amazing amount of diffused light. You can also shoot in the middle of the day with little worry about harsh lighting or unwanted shadows. Theres a catch though when shooting scenary feel in overcast conditions can also be challenging. Overcast skies are gray and don’t usually add a lot of interest to that mountainscape, or field of cows you want to photograph. Look for stormy weather clouds, that add a sense of place and dimension. You can also crop your shot so that you don’t get those unwanted gray skies, but still get great lighting. This means you will be shooting with the lower side of the settings like lower aperature, ISO, and Shutter Speed. Sunny Days Landscapes in bright sun are absolutely beautiful. Try shooting the beach in the full sun of the day usually around 1 or 2pm. Practice exposing for the beautiful blue skies as well as the sand. Make sure you have high aperature, ISO, and Shutterspeed to keep your shots from being over exposed. Of course this is always mannual correction when editing, but you want to take photos that need little to none editing when shooting. Practice Make sure you are always going back to shots and making sure they what you had in mind with the settings and the feel you are going for. You do not want to take a shot and then just think it was good enough, I always like to have about 4-6 shots with different settings and different feels. The reason being is that its always better to have opitions, because sometimes what you get out and about does not look the same when your uploading.

EXP EXP settings Tuning the EXP settings allows you to increase/decrease stick input sensitivity. The X-axis indicates user stick input and the Y-axis represents the “value” being output to the motors from these stick inputs. The higher the value, the more sensitive the drone can be towards the input stick movement. This is not to be confused with the next setting below. Sensitivity Sensitivity settings The sensitivity setting affects how rapidly the drone will respond to the input. A higher value would cause the drone to react more aggressively while a lower value would dull out that same input. Gain Gain settings Generally, the gain settingss are left alone. General comment for myself, try and get a drone to checkout some of these functions before you can specifically state what it is that they do. There are some contradicting pieces of information found on the “Gain” settings and I don’t want to give the wrong words of advice for something that can be sensitive to errors.

For starters, one must meet the qualifications in order to obtain the license such as Being at least 16 years of age Able to speak, read, write, and understand English Mentally and physically fit to fly your drone If you’ve met these qualifications, then you will need to get an FAA tracking number that can be obtained by creating an account through IACRA. To schedule your exam, you will need your FAA tracking number, then go to the PSI testing website to find a center to take your exam. I paid around $175 for the exam and would recommend studying at least 1-2 weeks prior to taking your exam. Step by step on how to schedule your exam Study Materials Now that you have scheduled your exam it is a good idea to watch videos, and other study guides to better prepare yourself for the exam. You will only need to score a 70% to pass; there are 60 questions on the exam that include aircraft operations, airport operations, regulations, airspace requirements, radio communications, weather, loading and performance, night flying regulations, flying over people, and remote identification (effective Sept. 2023). It may seem like a lot of information; however, I found these study guides most useful: UCDrones Airman Knowledge Testing Supplement (this is also the booklet given to you during your exam) How to read Sectional Charts New Drone Regulations Any online practice tests (FAA, King Schools, Pilot institute, jrupprechlaw.com, quizlet, etc.) You will be given 120 minutes, or 2 hours to complete the exam, but I found myself completing the exam within an hour. The test has a passing rate of about 92%. Some questions I was asked on the exam included the new laws on remote identification and what to do if it fails, nighttime flying regulations and what to do in certain scenarios, a few sectional charts (+ how to locate an airport using longitude and latitude), weather (+ how it can affect the drone operations), and crew resource management. What to Expect The center I took the exam was at the L&amp;J Aviation Inc. in Modesto, CA. In my experience they sent an email a day prior to the exam date with directions and driving instructions upon arrival to the correct building. When we entered the building, we went to the left and entered the door that said “L&amp;J Aviation Inc.”. We were then greeted by our proctor who collected our photo ID’s and stored all our belongings in a locked cabinet. We were then guided into a separate room with desks that had the monitors and cameras pointed at each of the desks. In the exam room we were given 2 pieces of blank paper, a clear sheet with an expo marker, and the Airman Knowledge Testing Supplement. We were then instructed to log onto the computers with the code given to us by our proctor and then we were asked to complete a mini practice test to familiarize ourselves on how to take the test. Once that was completed, we were allowed to begin the exam and were instructed to raise your hand when we were finished to have your proctor come pick you up and return to the office to discuss your exam results. After the Test If you passed the exam, congratulations!! Your proctor will give you your stamped scoresheet (do NOT lose this) and printed instructions on how to log back into IACRA to input your results. What do to after you’ve passed the exam After about a week of inputting your application on IACRA an email will be sent stating your temporary certificate is available. This may range from 1-4 weeks as a TSA background check will be completed. Feel free to check back periodically as my temporary certificate was available 4 days after my exam. You are NOT allowed to fly until you have your temporary certificate. The official license will come into the mail about 6-8 weeks after your exam. If you didn’t pass the exam, you can retake the exam after a 14-day period. After taking your exam the stamped scoresheet will list the topics that you missed, I’d highly advise to review those topics more thoroughly, and brush over the other topics to be better prepared. There are also training courses that you can pay for to help improve your prior score. You can review what questions you missed here. "],["studying-for-part-107.html", "Studying For Part 107", " Studying For Part 107 by Philana Ng Here is the link for instructions to sign up for the exam: https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/become_a_drone_pilot/ I passed the exam in November 2021 and will be writing about my experience. First off, I would recommend starting with this video from Tony and Chelsea Northuo. This video gives a brief overview of all the topics that you will need to study. Do not trust the comments that state that they passed by only watching that video. After watching the video, I would recommend memorizing Part 107 by the numbers. Not on this list are the conditions at standard sea level (chapter 3b of study guide). Next, I will break down the official FAA study guide. Videos will only get you 50% of the way on the new exam. Sorry to say, but you will have to read some parts of this study guide. Chapter 2: For each airspace class, know the ceiling and floor heights. This is very important for reading sectional charts. I had a question ask “Go 5 NM east of this point. What airspace are you in?”. Do not assume anything. A solid red line is class C, but you could be above the ceiling, making it class E. For the special use airspaces and other airspace areas, understand what happens in each case. I had questions that asked “What would you expected in a restricted area” and “At what speeds should you expect military aircrafts to be at in Military Training Routes”. Chapter 3: Reading METARs and TAFs are relatively straightforward. I watched a few YouTube videos to figure it out. For the sky condition acronyms, you would only need to memorize the common ones. Chapter 3b is quite annoying because there is a lot of information in there, but the exam will only choose a few topics. Topics that should definitely be on there are density altitude, stable/unstable air, and clouds. The rest is just the luck of the draw. 15% of my exam was about this section. Chapter 4: This is similar to chapter 3b where they throw a bunch of different information at you and only select a few on the exam. Things to note from this chapter are how CP and CG positioning changes the nose direction, effects of weight on performance, and calculating load factor. Chapter 5: This chapter is short, so I’d say to just read it. Chapter 7: I got two questions from this section. One was about the military alphabet and the other was about frequencies. Chapter 9: Memorize the definitions to a tee–things like causes, symptoms, effects on PIC, and what the PIC should do. Some questions will give you different scenarios and ask you what the best solution is. One scenario my colleague got was “You just drank a bottle of beer, but you feel fine. What should should you do?”. Chapter 10: My main mistakes in the exam were from this section. This was because all the YouTube study guides I watched passed this section. From this section, I got questions on the steps of decision making, assessing and mitigating risk, hazardous attitudes, etc. This is another section I would study up on. Depending on your exam, I would say chapter 9 and 10 make up 25% of the exam. Chapter 11: Sectional charts cover about 30% of your exam. I would say to just watch video after video to understand this. They will ask a lot of questions about airspace, ceilings, floors, finding certain landmarks, etc. Check this video out to see if you got tricked https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21b9hODOhGc .If you did, I would recommend studying more. As of 2021, the FAA has included new questions on flight over people and remote identification (I got 4 questions on these). None of the study guides or YouTube videos online had these questions. I had to read through the two links provided by the FAA. https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/operations_over_people/ https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/remote_id/ I HIGHLY recommend that you take this practice exam to get a rough estimate on what score you will get. https://3drobotics.com/quiz/faa-part-107/ Then watch the explanation video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IEjiWiFf5E&amp;t=0s Even after I prepared for the exam, there were still questions that I was not prepared for. When I checked the FAA study guide, sure enough, the answer was there. You don’t have to read the entire study guide, but I would recommended skimming it. Remember to take you time. Two hours gives you plenty of time to think. Bookmark the problems you are not sure of. Good luck! "],["part-107-experience.html", "Part 107 Experience Preparation Experience: Results and License:", " Part 107 Experience by Megan Phillips Preparation If you are preparing for the Part 107 exam, there are numerous ways to study that will be beneficial. The methods that I found the most useful were to first go over the material given in the FAA sUAS study guide to begin understanding all of the rules and regulations required for the exam. This study guide breaks down almost everything that can be seen on the test. After gaining a solid framework, I recommend testing your knowledge and going through some practice tests to begin seeing what topics you know well and what topics you may be struggling with. The practice tests I used were the: The FAA Sample Questions These are real test questions that have been used in the past on the Part 107 Exam and will most likely be very similar to the current questions being used. Half Chrome FAA Part 107 Test Walkthrough Video This is a video that goes through the FAA sample questions (1), gives you the correct answers, and explains the reasoning for that answer and why the other answers are incorrect. Drone Law and Drone Attorney Assistance Test This website teaches you the legal aspects of drone flying and helps you understand what each law entails. It gives you sample questions similar to those in (1) and then explains why your chosen answer is correct or incorrect based on the law it applies to. There are also other videos and articles online that may be useful for explaining specific things such as the METAR and TAF reports. Once you are ready to schedule your exam you can follow How to Schedule Your FAA Part 107. Experience: On the day before my exam, I received an email confirming my exam and the details concerning it, including location, time, documents to bring, etc. On my test day when I walked into the facility, I followed the signs posted and then I was greeted by my exam proctor who confirmed my information and asked for my documents to complete the paperwork. After this was complete, she handed me a basket to put my belongings in and then put them in a locked cabinet and took me and the other testers into the exam room and told us all of the rules and what we were to do if we have a question or when we are completed. During the test, you are given 120 minutes to take 60 questions, however, the exam only took me about an hour. You are given the FAA Chart Supplement, a plastic overlay, a whiteboard marker, and an eraser to use for the chart mapping questions. You are also given a calculator for any simple calculations you may need to perform during the exam. I used the chart supplement for a large majority of the questions of my exam version and did not have any calculations to warrant me using the calculator. Overall, I felt decently prepared for the exam based on my studying. Results and License: Once you finish your exam, the proctor will come get you from the test room, bring you back into the office, and let you know your score. If you pass, the proctor will give you your official paper with further instructions on how to go about getting your license. These are the steps to apply for your temporary sUAS pilot certificate: Temporary Pilot Certificate. Once you follow these steps, you have to wait until the email with your temporary certificate is sent to you before you may fly under Part 107 regulations. This email can take up to 4 weeks, however mine came back as early as 6 days so it just depends on how fast the information gets processed. After this, you may begin flying under Part 107 using your temporary certificate until your permanent license gets sent in the mail to you, which can take up to 2 months. If you did not pass the exam, you can retake the exam after 14 days. After your exam, your proctor will give you your score sheet with the topic areas that you missed listed on top. I’d recommend going back over those areas as well as any other areas you struggled with or would like some refreshing on using some of the materials listed above.
